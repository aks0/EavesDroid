###'g-force' computation

When a key is pressed, the accelerometer reads the x-, y- and z- direction
components of the acceleration of the vibration received. To get the
acceleration relative to the gravity, one needs to compute the following
**g-force** = ![equation](http://bit.ly/1nySUx2)

Here *g* = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> is the acceleration due to gravity.
