DISEASE and heedless management of wind turbines are killing North America bats with potentially devastating consequences for agriculture and human health We have yet to find a cure for the disease known as white nose syndrome which has decimated populations of hibernating cave dwelling bats in the Northeast  But we can reduce the turbine threat significantly without dismantling them or shutting them down White nose syndrome also known as was first documented in February  in upstate New York where it may have been carried from Europe to a bat cave on an explorer hiking boot In Europe bats appear to be immune likely the outcome of a long evolutionary process But in North America bats are highly susceptible to the cold loving fungus that appears in winter on the muzzle and other body parts during hibernation irritating them awake at a time when there is no food  They end up burning precious stores of energy and starve to death The consequences have been catastrophic  A  study of  sites across five Eastern states found that after  the populations of tri colored and Indiana bats declined by more than  percent and little brown bats by more than  percent  The population of the northern long eared bat once common has declined by an estimated  percent and prompted a proposal from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to list it as an endangered species  Other species of hibernating cave dwelling bats have declined precipitously as well Whether these bats will recover or go extinct is unclear  Meanwhile continues to spread rapidly  On the back of this year extremely cold winter it moved into Michigan and Wisconsin  It is now confirmed in  states and five Canadian provinces Tree dwelling bats seem to be affected by  since they hibernate in caves  But wind farms are killing them Wind turbines nationwide are estimated to kill between  and  bats a year according to a recent study in the journal BioScience  About half of those lost to turbines are hoary bats which migrate long distances seasonally throughout North America  Eastern red and silver haired bats commonly seen in Central Park in New York City hunting insects at night are also being killed by turbines by the tens of thousands We  afford to lose these creatures  In the Northeast all of our native bat species eat insects  One little brown bat can eat  mosquitoes in an hour reducing the potential for mosquito borne diseases  A colony of  big brown bats can protect crops from up to  million rootworms over a growing season  The Mexican free tailed bats of Bracken Cave in south central Texas consume about  tons of insects every summer night  The natural pest control provided by that species across eight Texas counties has been valued at nearly  as it protects the  million summer cotton crop  Nationwide the value of bats as pest controllers is estimated to be at least   billion and possibly much more  This leaves out the value of two other very important services that bats provide controlling insect borne diseases and pollinating commercially valuable plants CONTINUE READING THE MAIN STORY COMMENTS Today genetic engineering may seem to provide an effective way to protect crops from insects but pests have already developed resistance to some of these products  Insects also readily evolve resistance to chemical insecticides and increased use of these chemicals would come at a great cost to human health  But bats have shared the night skies with insects for at least  million years and they know how to hunt and eat them Fortunately we can reduce the mortality caused by wind farms which are often located on windy routes favored by some migratory bats  Wind turbines usually switch on automatically at wind speeds of about  to  miles per hour speeds at which insects and bats are active  But if during times of peak bat activity energy companies recalibrated their turbines to start at a wind speed of about  miles per hour which is too windy for insects and bats to fly turbine related deaths could be reduced by  to  percent according to a  study published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment  The effect on power output would be negligible  less than  percent annually Threats to bats also threaten us  We should step up research on the prevention and cure of white nose syndrome  And we should require energy companies to take steps to protect bats from collisions with wind turbines  It is foolish to spend enormous sums to create pesticides and transgenic crops to fight insects while investing little to protect bats our most efficient insect fighters
